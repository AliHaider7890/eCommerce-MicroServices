# eCommerce-MicroServices
This project is a microservices-based E-Commerce application built with Spring Boot (Java 21) and Angular. It follows a modular architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and fault tolerance. Each service handles a specific business responsibility and communicates asynchronously using Apache Kafka for event-driven messaging.
